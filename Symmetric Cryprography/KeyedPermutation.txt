1 byte is 8 bits 
AES is block cypher so it just takes blocks of plaintext ex 128 bits and scarmbles it to 
guve an output of also 128 bits. 
a key is needed to decrypt or unscramble this encryption
permutation is which type pf transformation is happening on the block
when i searched it up it said a bijective is when each input corresponds to exactly one output, 
and each output corresponds to exactly one input
