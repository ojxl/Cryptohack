brute force is when you dont know a definitive key or permutation so u try evrything possible
128 bit keyspace is 2^128 keys which is a number far too big to brute force 
thee is 1 known attack againts 128 bit key thats slightly better than brute forcing 
and it reduces the security from 128 to 126.1 bit and it hasny improved for the last 8 years 
and is still completely imparctical
this single key after a google search i found out is called Biclique
